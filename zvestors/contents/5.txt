# What is Value Investing?

### **Definition:**

> Value investing is a strategy where investors look for undervalued companies — stocks that are trading for less than their true worth — and buy them with the belief that their price will rise over time as the market corrects itself.
> 

You’re not buying just because it’s popular. You’re buying because it’s **worth more than it’s selling for**.

### **Definition (Simple):**

> Value investing is about buying quality stocks for less than they’re worth — like buying great sneakers on sale!
> 

### **The Big Idea:**

The stock market doesn’t always get prices right. Emotions like fear or hype cause **mispricing**.

Value investors take advantage of this by spotting high-quality businesses when they’re **on sale**.

It’s like:

- Buying an iPhone worth ₹80,000 for just ₹50,000
- Or investing in a strong company that’s temporarily cheap because of bad news or market panic.

## Core Principles of Value Investing:

### **1.Intrinsic Value: The True Worth of a Stock**

 **Definition:**

> Intrinsic value is the actual value of a company, based on its earnings, assets, and future potential — not just the stock price shown on the screen.
> 

Think of it like this: Just because something is **expensive** doesn’t mean it’s valuable. And just because something is **cheap**, doesn’t mean it’s worthless.

 **How it’s found?**

- Analysts use models like **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)**
- Use key data: **Earnings, growth rate, risk, debt**

 **Youth Example:**

Imagine a second-hand iPhone 13 being sold for ₹25,000. It’s in mint condition, good battery, and comes with warranty. You know it's **worth at least ₹35,000**. That ₹35,000 is the **intrinsic value** — and you just spotted a great deal.

### 2. **Margin of Safety: Your Safety Net**

 **Definition:**

> Margin of Safety means buying with a cushion — you invest only when the stock is significantly cheaper than its actual value.
> 

This helps reduce risk, even if your calculations are a bit off.

 **Formula (Simple Idea):**

Margin of Safety = Intrinsic Value – Market Price  

 **Why it matters?**

- It’s like having a helmet before riding a bike — **you’re protected** if things go wrong.

 **Youth Example:**

You think a concert ticket is worth ₹2,000. But someone’s selling it for ₹1,000. Even if the seat isn’t perfect, you still got a great deal — you had a **margin of safety**!

### 3.**Buying Businesses, Not Just Stocks**

 **Definition:**

> Value investors don’t just buy “stocks” — they buy a part of a real business.
> 

They ask:

- Is the business profitable?
- Does it have loyal customers?
- Can it grow in the future?

 **Tip:**

Use financial terms like:

- **Earnings per Share (EPS)**
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**
- **Debt-to-Equity (D/E)**

 **Youth Example:**

Would you rather buy a trending T-shirt brand or one with real loyal fans, steady profits, and no debt?

A value investor picks the **reliable brand** — not just the flashy one!

## Quote:

                  

**“Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.”**

*Meaning:*

                 Don’t follow the crowd. Buy good companies when everyone is panicking and prices drop.

*Youth Take:*

                 It's like shopping during clearance sales — you get the best deals when others aren’t                              looking.
