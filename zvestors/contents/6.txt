# Finding Undervalued Stocks:

### Step 1: Apply Your Basics

Use what you’ve already learned in the course:

- Understand terms like **P/E ratio, EPS, Market Cap, Book Value, D/E ratio, ROI**.
- Recognize how **qualitative factors** (like leadership, brand, and business model) impact company value.

This foundation is key to judging if a stock is worth the price.

### Step 2: Where to Look

### Use Stock Screener Tools:

Platforms like:

- **Screener.in** (India-specific)
- **Tickertape**, **Simply Wall Street**, **Trendlyne**

Use filters to find:

- Low P/E stocks
- High ROE stocks
- Low D/E (debt) companies
- High EPS growth

These platforms save time and show instant red flags/green flags.

### Read Investor Reports:

- Read **Annual Reports (AR)**: Management talks, revenue trends, risks.
- Check **Investor Presentations** for future goals.
- Follow expert investors (ValuePickr, Smartkarma, etc.)

---

### Step 3: Spot the Red Flags

Watch out for:

- High debt (D/E > 2)
- Low or falling profits (EPS drop)
- Frequent share dilution
- Poor corporate governance (check promoter holding, resignations, fraud news)

---

### Step 4: Look for Green Flags

Search for:

- Strong and consistent EPS growth
- Low P/E compared to peers (but not extremely low)
- High Return on Equity (ROE > 15%)
- Promoter holding > 50%
- Consistent dividend pay-outs

---

### Step 5: Use a Checklist

Create your own checklist before picking a stock. Example:

| Criteria | Threshold | Met? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P/E Ratio | < 20 (or less than industry avg) | ✅ |
| ROE | > 15% | ✅ |
| D/E Ratio | < 1 | ✅ |
| Promoter Holding | > 50% | ✅ |
| EPS Growth (5 Yrs) | Positive | ✅ |
| Dividend History | Consistent | ✅ |

This helps avoid emotional decisions.

### Step 6: Compare with Peers

Compare:

- ITC vs Godfrey Philips
- IRCTC vs Indian Hotels
- Infosys vs Wipro

Check P/E, EPS, ROE, and price growth over years.

---

### Step 7: Apply Qualitative Filters

Ask:

- Is this company easy to understand?
- Do they have a **brand moat** (e.g., IRCTC’s monopoly)?
- Are they solving a long-term problem?
- Is the leadership trustworthy and visionary?

### Example: ITC (during early 2020–2021)

### Market Sentiment:

People joked “ITC never moves”.
But here’s what smart investors saw:

- **P/E Ratio**: Very low (~13–14) vs Nifty avg (~25)
- **Dividend Yield**: High (~5–6%)
- **ROE**: ~23%
- **Diversified Business**: Cigarettes, FMCG, Hotels, Paper
- **Zero Debt**
- **Strong Promoter Holding**

 **Result**: Stock went from ₹160 to ₹450+ in 3 years 

That’s the power of spotting **value before the hype**.
