## 2.  **Use Bucket-Style Investing**

### Definition:

Divide your investments into **"buckets"** based on **goals, time horizon, and risk**.

This avoids emotional investing and helps with long-term planning.

### The Buckets:

| Bucket | Use Case | Risk Level | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 🚨 Emergency | For medical bills, sudden expenses | Low | Bank FD, Liquid Fund |
| 🎯 Short-term | For 1–2 year goals | Medium | Hybrid Mutual Fund |
| 🚀 Long-term | Wealth creation (5+ years) | High | Stocks, ETFs |

### Example:

You're a college student and you invest ₹500/month.

- ₹100 to Liquid Fund (emergency)
- ₹150 to Mutual Fund (short-term)
- ₹250 to Stocks (long-term wealth)

> This method brings clarity & balance.
