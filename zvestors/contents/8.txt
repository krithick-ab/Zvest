# Quantitative Analysis

## Quantitative Analysis is a method used in finance/stock market relies on math and statistics to understand and predict the value of asset class like stocks, mutual funds and etc.

## These analysis helps to decide:

1. When to Buy?
2. When to Sell?
3. How risky a Trade is?
4. How much profit they might make?

## **Example: Shopping at a Sale**

Imagine you're shopping online for shoes. You want to get the **best deal**. So, over the past 6 months, you’ve tracked:

- Price changes every week
- When the shoe goes out of stock
- When big discounts usually happen (festive sales, weekends)

You notice a **pattern**:

- The price drops 30% during the first week of every month.
- It sells out quickly after that.

So, using this **data**, you create a simple rule for yourself:

> "I will buy these shoes if they are 30% off and it's the first week of the month."

# 1. P/E ratio: Price to Earnings Ratio

    

 SIMPLE DEFINITION:

### It is a measure of how much an Investor is willing to pay for a share compared to the profitability of underlying business.

  DEFENITION BASED ON FORMULA:

### It is the ratio of current market price of one share to                                                  earnings per share

                    CALCULATED BY:

                                       P/E ratio = Price of one share(CMP) / Earnings per share(EPS)

         

                                          EPS = EPS = Total Net Profit / Total Number of Shares

## Example :

**Imagine this:**

You and your friend are thinking of investing in a small pizza shop.

There are **2 shops** for sale:

### Shop A:

- Price to buy the shop = ₹10 lakhs
- Yearly profit = ₹2 lakhs
    
    → **P/E Ratio = 10,00,000 / 2,00,000 = 5**
    

### Shop B:

- Price to buy the shop = ₹20 lakhs
- Yearly profit = ₹2 lakhs
    
    → **P/E Ratio = 20,00,000 / 2,00,000 = 10**
    

### So, What Does This Mean?

- Shop A's P/E is **5** → You are paying ₹5 to earn ₹1
- Shop B's P/E is **10** → You are paying ₹10 to earn ₹1

## Summary:

> Lower P/E = cheaper deal (but not always better)
> 
> 
> **Higher P/E = market expects more growth**
> 

So P/E helps you know **how much you're paying for ₹1 of a company's earnings** — just like valuing a pizza shop!

# 2.Earnings per Share(EPS):

SIMPLE DEFENITION:

### EPS tells you how much profit a company makes for every single share.

### If you own 1 share, EPS shows **how much money that share earned**                        during the year.

                   CALCULATED BY:

                                                  EPS = Total Net Profit / Total Number of Shares

 

## **Example (Donut Shop)**

  Let’s say:

- Donut Co. made ₹10,00,000 profit this year
- It has 1,00,000 total shares

### So:

         EPS = ₹10,00,000 / 1,00,000 = ₹10

### Meaning:

                     Each share earned ₹10 profit this year.

                     If you had 1 share, you “own” ₹10 of the company’s earnings (not cash in hand, but value).

## Summary:

- High EPS = Company is making more money per share
- Low EPS = Not much profit per share (could be risky or still growing)

---

# 3. Market capitalization(market cap):

SIMPLE DEFENITION:

### Market Capitalization is a value attains by product of total number of   outstanding shares and current market price of one share of the respective company.

### This value represents the total market value of all of a company's outstanding shares and is a key metric for understanding a company's size and overall market value.

### Formula:

                     Market capitalization = total no. of outstanding shares * current market price of one share

## **Example: Burger Bros Ltd.**

       

 Let’s say a company called **Burger Bros Ltd.** has:

- **Share Price** = ₹200
- **Total Shares** = 10,00,000 (10 lakh shares)

Then,

          Market Cap = ₹200 × 10,00,000 = ₹20,00,00,000 (₹20 Crores)

### Burger Bros is worth **₹20 Crores in the stock market**.

If someone wants to “buy the whole company,” in theory, they’d need to pay ₹20 crores — that’s the company’s **market value**.

## Summary:

- **Large Cap** = Big, stable companies (like Reliance, TCS)
- **Mid Cap** = Growing companies (like Indigo)
- **Small Cap** = Small but risky companies (like micro startups)

---

# 4. Book value:

SIMPLE DEFENITION:

### Book Value is the **total value of a company’s assets** minus its  **liabilities (what it owes)**

### It tells you **what the company is worth on paper** — like its "true value" if it was shut down today and everything was sold.

CALCULATED BY:

### Book Value = Total Assets – Total Liabilities

## Example: A Company.inc

                         

If a company.inc has:

- Assets worth ₹100 Crores
- Debts of ₹20 Crores

### Then the **book value = ₹80 Crores**

If the company has **10 crore shares**, then:

                       Book Value per Share = ₹80 Crores ÷ 10 Crores = ₹8

## Summary:

- If a stock’s **market price is lower than its book value**, it might be **undervalued** (good for long-term investors)
- High book value means the company has **strong assets and less debt**

---

# 5. Debt to equity Ratio(D/E):

SIMPLE DEFENITION:

### The Debt-to-Equity ratio shows **how much money a company has borrowed (debt)** compared to **how much money the owners/shareholders have invested (equity)**.

CALCULATED BY:

                               D/E Ratio = Total Debt / Shareholder’s Equity

![b2a7707f-21d9-41ef-82f4-92f2ac088f8e.png](attachment:abbf8ce6-d7ca-41db-bc5f-4354f791bc9e:270c3156-fae6-471f-856f-c7327df6ab06.png)

## **Example:**

Imagine your friend Arjun starts a food truck business:

- He takes a **loan of ₹5 lakhs** (debt)
- He invests **₹2 lakhs from his own savings** (equity)

### D/E Ratio = ₹5,00,000 ÷ ₹2,00,000 = **2.5**

    This means Arjun is using ₹2.5 of **borrowed money** for every ₹1 of **his own money**.

## Summary:

- **Low D/E** = Company is using more of its **own money** to run the business (safer).
- **High D/E** = Company is using **more loans** (riskier, especially if profits fall).

---

# 6. Price to Book Value:

SIMPLE DEFENITION:

### It shows whether a stock is **cheap (undervalued)** or **expensive (overvalued)** based on its real worth.

### The **P/B ratio** tells you **how much investors are paying for a company compared to its actual book value** (the value of what the company owns minus what it owes).

CALCULATED BY:

                                 P/B RATIO = Share price / Book Value per share(BVPS)

### Example:

### If a company's stock price is ₹100 and its book value per share is ₹50:

### P/B Ratio = 100 ÷ 50 = 2

 This means investors are paying **₹2 for every ₹1 of the company’s real value**.

### Key Takeaways:

- The price-to-book (P/B) ratio measures the market's valuation of a company relative to its book value.
- The market value of equity is typically higher than the book value of a company's stock.
- The price-to-book ratio is used by value investors to identify potential investments.
- P/B ratios under 1.0 are typically considered solid investments by value investors.
- A good P/B ratio is relative to a business and its industry.

# 7.Return on Investing(ROI):

SIMPLE DEFENITION:                                                                    

### ROI shows **how much profit you made from an investment compared to how much you spent.** It’s written as a **percentage** to easily compare different investments.

CALCULATED BY:

### ROI = (Gain – Cost) ÷ Cost × 100

## Example: **Burger Shop Investment**

                                      Let’s say you invest **₹10,000** in a small burger stall.

                                     After a few months, you earn **₹13,000** from it (including your investment + profit).

- **Gain = ₹13,000**
- **Cost = ₹10,000**

                                     ROI = (13,000 – 10,000) ÷ 10,000 × 100
                                             = 3,000 ÷ 10,000 × 100
                                             = 30%

    You made a **30% return** on your investment. For every ₹100 you spent, you earned ₹130 (₹30 profit).

# 8. Promoter Holding:

SIMPLE DEFENITION:

### **Promoter holding** is the **percentage of shares in a company owned by its promoters**.

### Promoters are the **founders, owners, or key people** who started or control the company. This tells us **how much skin the original creators have in the game**.

## **Example: Pizza Boss Ltd.**

- Total shares of the company = 1,00,000
- Promoter (the founder) owns = 60,000 shares

### Promoter Holding = (60,000 ÷ 1,00,000) × 100
                                  = 60%

The **promoter owns 60%** of the company. That’s a strong holding — it shows they have **major control** and **confidence** in their own business.

SUMMARY:

                     **High promoter holding** (50% or more) = Promoters are confident and involved.

                     **Low promoter holding** = Could mean they’re slowly exiting or less interested.

---

# 9. Dividend Yield:

        SIMPLE DEFENITION:

### Dividend Yield tells you **how much money (dividend) a company pays you every year compared to its stock price**— shown as a percentage.

### It’s like the **interest you earn for holding a stock.**

FORMULA:

                    Dividend Yield = (Annual Dividend ÷ Share Price) × 100

## **Example: Orange Ltd.**

- **Share Price** = ₹200
- **Annual Dividend** = ₹10 per share

        Dividend Yield =  (10 ÷ 200) × 100 = 5%

## Summary:

    If you buy 1 share of Orange Ltd. at ₹200, you’ll get ₹10 every year as dividend.

    That’s a **5% return** just from holding the stock — even before the price moves up!

### It’s like buying a ₹200 headphone and the company gives you ₹10 cashback **every year** just for owning it.

---

# 10. Face Value:

                            SIMPLE DEFENITION:

### **Face Value** (also called **Par Value**) is the **original price of a share** set by the                       c8                                       company when it is first issued.

                            It has **nothing to do with the market price**.

                            It is just an **accounting number** used for calculating things like dividends,                                                                    share capital, etc.

## Example:

                                                      Let’s say a company called **Tech Vibe Ltd.** issues shares with:

- **Face Value** = ₹10
- **Market Price** = ₹150

                                    This means:

- The company originally set each share's base value at ₹10
- But people are now buying/selling it at ₹150 in the stock market

### Why Face Value Matters:

- Dividends are often declared **on face value**
    - e.g. "100% dividend on ₹10 face value" = ₹10 dividend
- Helps calculate **share capital** of the company
    - e.g. 1,00,000 shares × ₹10 = ₹10,00,000 share capital
    
    ## Summary:
    
                                Think of face value like the **MRP printed on a sneaker box** 
    
                                But in resale, the **market price** can be much higher or lower based on demand.

    # 11.Market capitalization to sales ratio:
    
    ## **Definition**:
    
                                  The **Market Cap to Sales Ratio** compares a company’s **total market value** to its **total revenue (sales)**.
    
                                   It tells you **how much investors are paying for ₹1 of the company’s sales**.
    
    ### **Formula**:
                       Market Cap to Sales Ratio = Market Cap / Total Annual sales (Revenue)
    
    ### **Why it Matters**:
    
    - If the ratio is **too high**, the stock may be **overvalued**.
    - If the ratio is **low**, it could be **undervalued** or a good value-buy (if other things are strong).
    
    ## **Example: Hype Sneaker Store**
    
    Imagine your college friend Arjun owns a sneaker business 👟
    
    - His business is valued at **₹10 lakhs** (this is like Market Cap — what buyers are willing to pay)
    - His total sales revenue last year = **₹2 lakhs**
    
    ## So:
    
                   Market Cap to Sales=1000000 / 200000 = 5
    
    ### That means:
    
                   Investors are paying ₹5 for every ₹1 of sales his business generates.
    
    ## Now Compare:
    
    ### Another store: Riya's Sneaker Shop
    
    - Market Cap = ₹6 lakhs
    - Sales = ₹3 lakhs
    
    ### **Ratio = 600000 / 3000000 = 2**
    
       
    
                                Here, investors are paying **only ₹2 for ₹1 of sales**.
    
                                Riya's store may be **a better deal** (lower ratio), assuming profits are good too.
    
    ## Summary:
    
    | Store | Market Cap | Sales | Ratio | Investor paying ₹ for ₹1 sales |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | Arjun's | ₹10L | ₹2L | 5 | ₹5 |
    | Riya's | ₹6L | ₹3L | 2 | ₹2 |
    
    ### Rule of Thumb:
    
    - **Lower ratio** = undervalued or better value (but check profit too)
    - **Higher ratio** = possibly overvalued (unless company is a growth rocket)
