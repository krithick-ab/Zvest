# The Power Of Compounding

### What Is Compounding?

**Definition:**

> Compounding is when you earn returns on your past returns. It’s like planting a money tree—your initial investment grows, and that growth itself keeps growing.
> 

**Gen-Z Example:**

Imagine you save ₹500 every month. At the end of the year, you have ₹6,000. Now, imagine this amount earns interest. Next year, not only your new ₹6,000 but also the **interest earned** earns more interest. That’s compounding!

### 1.**SIP vs. Lump Sum: What Works for Whom?**

### **SIP (Systematic Investment Plan)**

**Definition:**

> SIP means investing a fixed amount regularly (like ₹500/month), usually in mutual funds or ETFs.
> 

**Best for:**

- Beginners
- Salaried students
- People with limited funds but consistent income

**Example:**

You invest ₹500/month for 20 years. Assuming 12% annual return, it grows to **₹5+ Lakhs** from just ₹1.2 Lakhs invested!

### **Lump Sum Investment**

**Definition:**

> Lump sum means investing a large amount at once (e.g., ₹50,000 in one go).
> 

**Best for:**

- People with saved-up funds
- Investors during market corrections

**Example:**

You invest ₹50,000 in one go. With 12% annual return, it grows to **₹5 Lakhs+** in 20 years.

### 2.**Magic of Compounding – Stay Invested!**

**Key Idea:**

> The longer you stay invested, the more your money compounds. The real magic happens after 10–15 years.
> 

**Visual Example:**

Let’s compare two people:

| Person | Starts at age | Invests ₹500/month | Stops at age | Total Invested | Final Value at 40 yrs (12% return) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | 20 | ₹500/month | 30 | ₹60,000 | ₹9.8 Lakhs |
| B | 30 | ₹500/month | 40 | ₹60,000 | ₹3 Lakhs |

Even though both invested the same amount, **Person A earns 3x more** because they started early!

### **3.Staying Invested Through Ups & Downs**

**Definition:**

> The market goes up and down—but compounding rewards those who stay invested during rough times.
> 

**Example:**

In 2020, markets crashed during COVID-19. But those who held on saw their investments double by 2022!

**Lesson:** Don’t panic and withdraw. Stay consistent. Your long-term returns will balance short-term volatility.

### **Value Investing Is Boring—And That’s a Good Thing**

**Definition:**

> Value investing is slow and steady. You don’t chase trends or trade every day. You buy quality businesses and let compounding do the work.
> 

**Gen-Z Analogy:**

It’s like being in a long-term relationship with a good person—not the most “exciting” every day, but super reliable and fulfilling in the long run
