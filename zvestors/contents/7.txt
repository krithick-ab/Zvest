Common mistakes to avoid as a beginner in stock market
1.  Chasing Trends (FOMO)
Definition:
Jumping into stocks or assets just because everyone is talking about it or the price is going up fast — out of Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO).
Why it's risky:
You're not investing based on research or logic, but emotion. Once the hype fades, the price usually crashes.
Example (Gen Z style):
Imagine you see all your friends buying Dogecoin after Elon Musk tweets about it. You invest at ₹60 thinking it will go to the moon. A week later, it crashes to ₹5.
Lesson: Don’t buy just because it’s trending. Trends don’t always mean long-term value.
2.  Over-Diversifying
Definition:
Spreading your money across too many stocks or mutual funds, thinking it reduces risk.
Why it's bad:
Diversification is good, but overdoing it makes it hard to track your investments or build conviction in any company.
Example:
You invest ₹500 each in 20 random companies from different sectors. Now you're holding pharma, tech, steel, real estate, finance... but you don’t know what any of them actually do.
Even if one stock performs really well, it won’t impact your portfolio much.
Better strategy: Choose 5–10 good businesses you understand and track them well.
3.  Ignoring Red Flags
Definition:
Overlooking warning signs in a company just because it looks attractive or the stock is going up.
Why it's dangerous:
These red flags may include high debt, bad management, fake profits, or legal issues — and they often signal deeper problems.
Example:
A company gives bumper returns in 6 months, but you ignore that the promoter has pledged 80% of shares and the company has zero profits.
A few months later, the company collapses, and your investment is gone.
Always check fundamentals, promoter behavior, and news.
4.  Trying to Time the Market
Definition:
Trying to guess the perfect time to buy low and sell high.
Why it's unrealistic:
Even professionals can’t consistently time the market. It creates stress, overtrading, and missed opportunities.
Example:
You wait for Sensex to crash to 50,000 to buy, but it never comes down. Meanwhile, your money sits idle in your bank.
Or you sell your stocks thinking a crash is coming, but the market goes up 20% after that.
Better strategy: Follow SIP or regular investing with discipline.
5.  Selling Too Early
Definition:
Selling your investments for a small profit without letting them grow over time.
Why it's costly:
You might miss out on compound growth and multibagger returns by exiting early.
Example (Real case):
Someone invested in Infosys in the 1990s and sold it after it doubled in 1 year.
If they had held it for 10–20 years, the returns could've been 10,000%+ due to compounding.
Tip: Hold on to fundamentally strong companies for the long term.
