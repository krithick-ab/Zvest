# Your Money: Sleeping  or Working??

## First, Let’s Think:

When you earn money (salary, pocket money, profits), what do you do with it?

- Keep it in your savings account?
- Store it in a piggy bank?
- Hide it in your drawer?

If so…

**Your money is safe, BUT it’s sleeping.** 

## What Does "Sleeping Money" Mean?

It means your money is **just sitting there**, not **growing** or **doing anything useful** for you.

It’s not helping you **make more money**. That’s not very smart.

## Example:

### **Sleeping Money (Lazy Money)**

Let’s say your friend **Rahul** got ₹5,000 for his birthday.

He:

- Puts ₹4,000 in his savings account
- Buys pizza with ₹1,000
- 1 year later — the ₹4,000 is still ₹4,000 (maybe ₹4,040 if lucky)

 His money is **doing nothing**. It’s just **sleeping** in the bank like it’s on a vacation 

### Now, What is "Working Money"?

**Working money** is money that is put into:

- **Investments** (like stocks, mutual funds, etc.)
- **Businesses**
- **Assets that grow in value**

 When your money is working, it **creates more money for you** — even when you're sleeping! 

This is called:

**“Let your money work for you, not just you work for money.”**

## Example:

### **Working Money (Smart Money)**

Now imagine his friend **Priya** also got ₹5,000.

But instead of letting it sleep:

- She invests ₹3,000 in a **mutual fund or stock**
- She leaves ₹1,000 in savings
- She uses ₹1,000 for coffee and a Netflix plan

1 year later, her ₹3,000 investment has become **₹3,600**

 Her money is **working part-time**, like a Swiggy delivery guy, and bringing her **extra cash** 

## Final Summary:

> You scroll daily, binge watch daily —
> 
> 
> Now it’s time to make your **money hustle daily** too 
> 

 Even if you start with ₹100/month, you’re telling your money:

**“Don’t sleep. Go out and earn me more!”**

## 1. **What is Savings?**

### **Definition:**

Savings is the money you **keep aside** (not spend) for future use — usually in a bank account or at home.

### **Example:**

You earn ₹1,000 from a part-time gig and spend ₹700 on food & fun.

You save ₹300 in your Paytm wallet = That’s savings.

### **Bonus Tip:**

Savings is the **first step** to building wealth, but it doesn't grow much on its own.

## 2. **How Savings is Affected by Inflation**

### **Definition:**

**Inflation** means prices go up over time. So, the **value of your saved money drops** slowly because you can buy less with it.

TECHNICAL DEFENITION:

                                           Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services                                            rises in an economy over a period of time, leading to a decrease in the                                                           purchasing power of money.

### **Example:**

In 2015, a chocolate bar was ₹10.

In 2025, it’s ₹20.

If you had saved ₹100 in 2015, you could buy 10 bars.

But in 2025, with that same ₹100, you get only 5.

Your savings **lost value** — even though the number ₹100 didn’t change.

### **Bonus Tip:**

If your savings don’t **grow faster than inflation**, you’re **actually losing money silently**.

## 3. **What is Investment?**

**Definition:**

Investment is when you **use your money to earn more money** — by putting it into stocks, mutual funds, real estate, or businesses.

### **Example:**

You invest ₹1,000 in a company’s stock. After 1 year, its value becomes ₹1,300.

That extra ₹300 = **your money worked** and earned for you!

### **Bonus Tip:**

Unlike savings, **investments grow over time**, even while you sleep

# 4. Types Of Investments

         

### 1. **Stocks (Equity Shares)**

 **Definition:**

A **stock** represents a **share in the ownership of a company** and constitutes a claim on part of the company’s assets and earnings. When you buy a stock, you become a **partial owner (shareholder)** of that company.

 **Key Points:**

- You can earn money through **capital appreciation** (price increase) and **dividends** (company's profit sharing).
- Stock prices fluctuate based on company performance, market conditions, and investor sentiment.
- Traded on stock exchanges like NSE and BSE in India.

 **Example:**

If you buy 10 shares of **Tata Motors**, you own a small part of the company. If Tata Motors performs well, the value of your shares may rise, and you might even get dividend payouts.

---

### 2. **Mutual Funds**

 **Definition:**

A **mutual fund** is a **pooled investment vehicle** where money from many investors is collected and managed by a professional fund manager. The fund manager invests this money in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities, based on the fund’s goal.

 **Key Points:**

- Ideal for beginners due to **professional management**.
- Offers **diversification**, reducing risk.
- Can be **actively managed** or **passively managed (like index funds)**.
- Returns depend on the performance of the underlying assets.

 **Example:**

If 1,000 investors invest ₹1,000 each in a mutual fund, the fund manager pools ₹10 lakhs and strategically invests in multiple companies. Each investor gets **units** representing their share in the fund.

---

### 3. **Bonds**

 **Definition:**

A **bond** is a **fixed-income instrument** that represents a **loan made by an investor to a borrower**, typically a corporation or government. In return, the borrower promises to pay back the money with **interest (called a coupon)** at fixed intervals and return the principal at maturity.

 **Key Points:**

- Considered **safer** than stocks.
- Offers **predictable income**.
- Used by governments and corporations to raise capital.
- Can be traded in the bond market.

 **Example:**

You buy a ₹10,000 bond from the Government of India with a 7% annual interest rate. Every year, you get ₹700 as interest, and after the bond matures (say, in 5 years), you get back your ₹10,000.

## 4.Gold:

               **Definition:**

                               **Gold** is a **physical or digital asset** that holds intrinsic value and has been used as a                                   store of wealth for centuries. As an investment, gold is considered a **"safe haven"                                     asset**, especially during times of market volatility, inflation, or economic uncertainty.

You can invest in gold in **different forms**, such as:

- Physical gold (jewelry, coins, bars)
- Digital gold
- Gold ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)
- Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)

### **Key Points:**

- **Low-to-medium risk**, depending on the form.
- Protects against **inflation and currency devaluation**.
- Does **not generate regular income** like interest or dividends.
- Highly **liquid**—easily converted to cash.
- Value influenced by global prices, currency, and demand.

### **Gen-Z Example:**

Let’s say you bought 1 gram of gold in 2015 for ₹2,500. In 2025, that same gold is worth ₹6,500. Even if you didn’t “do” anything, your money grew because gold appreciates over time.

And today, you don’t even need to buy physical gold—you can invest ₹100 in **Digital Gold** via apps like PhonePe or Groww.

## 5.Savings Account:

                         Definition:

                                           The money you are putting in your bank savings account for your future, it pays you interest at the rate of 6 to 7% annually. This Instrument is safe to put your money.

### Advantage:

                                         In savings account, Treasury bills and CDs, your money is insured against losses, so you’re guaranteed to get your money back.

### Disadvantage:

                                         The major problem associated with this investment instrument is they pay                                                  very low rate of interest. Sometimes, The interest rate you get in Fixed                                                          Deposit(Savings account) can’t even keep up with inflation .

### Example:

                                         If you are putting your money in savings account and assume that they are                                                 paying interest at the rate of 5%, but the Inflation(rise in prices of goods) is                                                 7%. So, at net you are losing 2% at the end of the year.

The first goal of saving and Investing is to keep ahead of Inflation. Your money’s on a treadmill that’s constantly going backward

### Conclusion:

                             That’s the problem with leaving money in bank or savings accounts. The money is safe in short run, because it’s insured against loss, but in the long run, it’s likely to lose ground against taxes and inflation.

# 5.Price is what u pay.. Value is what u get

                                                                                        - Warren Buffet

### Definition:

### The price is just the amount of money you pay for something.

### The value is the real worth or benefit you get from it.

This concept reminds us that **expensive doesn’t always mean good**, and **cheap doesn’t always mean bad**.

        

## **Gen-Z Example: Sneakers**

Let’s say:

- You buy **Sneaker A** for ₹5,000
    
    – It looks cool, but wears out in 3 months
    
    – You rarely use it
    
- Your friend buys **Sneaker B** for ₹2,500
    
    – Not a brand name, but super comfortable
    
    – Lasts 2 years, used daily
    

### What happened?

- You **paid more** (₹5,000), but got **less value**
- Your friend **paid less**, but got **more value**

That’s **price ≠ value**.

## **Stock Market Example**

Two stocks:

- **Company X**: Stock price = ₹100
    
    Earnings per share (EPS) = ₹2
    
    → High price, **low profit = low value**
    
- **Company Y**: Stock price = ₹50
    
    EPS = ₹5
    
    → Low price, **high profit = high value**
    

 Company Y gives **better value for money**, even though it’s cheaper.

## Final Thought:

### “Smart investors focus on value, not just price.”

Because **real wealth** is built by paying the **right price for maximum benefit**.
